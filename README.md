# Shalana07

**Shalana07** is a multivendor avatar customizing app with integrated gamification features, designed for families and communities. The application empowers parents to assign tasks to their children, who can earn coins as rewards by completing these tasks. Children can then use their coins to purchase and customize digital avatars—selecting from a wide range of accessories such as dresses, hairstyles, eyes, jewelry, pets, and more—all in real time.

## Key Features

- **Multivendor Avatar Shop**: Browse and purchase avatar parts and accessories from different vendors.

- **Task Assignment & Rewards**: Parents assign tasks to their children; children earn coins by completing tasks.
